Introduction:

This software is a collection of RIBClients developed for languages other than
the original language C.

This software came about because I needed to prototype tools initially in
Python and found a need to be able to write out compressed and binary RIB.

While there were a number of Python modules writing out RIB files, none were
writing out binary RIB which was important at the time of my visualization
research. Moreover, I wanted to learn more about SWIG and the internals of
popular scripting languages like Python and Ruby, hence the birth of the
project.
